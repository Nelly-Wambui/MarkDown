## The Walk
Stella and I were walking down the *Nature Trail* in the **Stay Away Forest** when we bumped into Maggie. We were so dehydrated and luckily she had a few fruits to offer: 
* Apple
* Banana
* Grapes

We decided to walk together after sharing the fruits and got done with the walk at about quarter past 4. We were happy with our little adventure, and not only took photos of ourselves having fun but also of some monkeys that caught our eyes. One of them was a beautiful photo depicting a `mother's bond with her little one`.

It was a beautiful day to remind ourselves of this:
> A breath of fresh air is a great thing to take and even better thing to be
